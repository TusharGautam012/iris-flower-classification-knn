# Iris Flower Classification using KNN :

This project is a Machine Learning classification model built using the famous Iris Flower Dataset.
The goal is to classify flowers into one of the following species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

## Dataset
The Iris dataset contains 150 samples with the following features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

## Algorithm Used
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Technologies & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Steps Performed
1. Imported required libraries
2. Loaded and explored the dataset
3. Split data into training and testing sets
4. Trained KNN model
5. Predicted flower species
6. Evaluated model accuracy

## Result
- Model Accuracy:100%(1.0) on test data

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter
3. Run all cells
